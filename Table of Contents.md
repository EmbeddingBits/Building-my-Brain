## ðŸ”— Interconnections

The graph view is intentionally built around:
- README hubs (for folders and domains)
- Bidirectional links from modules and notes to parent READMEes
- Cross-domain links between College and Personal topics
  - e.g. `[[College/DSA/README]]` â†” `[[Personal/Programming/algorithms/README]]`
  - e.g. `[[College/Microprocessor and Microcontrollers/README]]` â†” `[[Personal/electronics/microcontrollers/README]]`
