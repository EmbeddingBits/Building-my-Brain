# Frames

This term is commonly referred to as the messages that travel at the lower level of the OSI model. They are associated with the [[Datalink-Layer|Datalink layer]] of the OSI model. They are also sometimes used in the [[Physical-Layer|physical layer]], when the message formatting is done by a layer one technology.

They are called as frames because, they are created by taking different higher layer messages or [[Datagrams]] and framing them with information like headers which are required at the lower level.
