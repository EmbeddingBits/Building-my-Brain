# Switching Methods

There are numerous in which systems can communicate with each other, from the model they use to the paths the data chooses.

In this note, there are notes regarding the switching methods. There are two ways in which data can be transferred:
- Circuit Switching
- Packet Switching

## Circuit Switching

In circuit switching, a connection called a circuit is formed between the devices. A connection is formed between the devices even before the communication between the system. The path can be permanent or can change depending upon the situation.

Example: One of the most common example is the telephone system.

## Packet Switching

In this type of network, the data to be sent is divided into smaller parts called packets. It does not follow a given path, and its randomly sent over the network. 

On the receiving end, the packets are read are joined together to form the original message.

There is no better type of switching method in reality. One method is better in a system while the other is not. But in reality, both of the switching methods are used simultaneously.
