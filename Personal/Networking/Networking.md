## Computer Networks

Network is a collection of computers or hardware devices that are connected together either physically or logically using special hardware that allow them to exchange information.

Network is one of the hardest concepts of computing. Even the smallest application of a network contains different other components working together to give the best experience.

So, to understand them more efficiently, we split them into smaller divisions which in a way makes more sense then swallowing it as a whole.

They are divided into Networking Layers, Networking Models and Networking Architectures.

This sections contains all the information I've learnt regarding Networks.
