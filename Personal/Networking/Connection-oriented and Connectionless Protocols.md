# Connection-oriented and Connectionless Protocols

Another way in which networks and protocols are differentiated is by whether they use connection between a device or not. This is a concept that is close linked with [[Switching Methods|packet and circuit switching]].

## Connection-Oriented protocols

As inferred from the name, for the data transfer to happen, a connection must be established between both of the system. This is governed by a set of rules that say how a connection should be initiated, negotiated, maintained and get terminated.

Usually it happens by one of the device sending a request to the other device to open a connection.

## Connectionless Protocols

These protocols do not establish a connection. When a device has a data to send, it just sends it over the internet.
