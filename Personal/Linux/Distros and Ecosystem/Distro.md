# Introduction

Linux Distributions (or distros) are different versions of the Linux kernel made for specific purposes and they follow their own philosophy of using the distro. It is the Linux kernel tailored for different needs.

There are different distros which follow their own philosophy and methods of operating like:
- [[Personal/Linux/Distros/Arch|Arch]] - Arch is one of the many's favourite distro and it has its own idiom/meme that goes "I use Arch btw". It follows a DIY approach. After installation, you get a completely stock system and you configure it from the base to what you need. More information could be found here [[Arch]].

- [[Personal/Linux/Distros/Debian|Debian]] - Debian is kind of opposite to Arch. It focuses on simplicity and many of the software comes preinstalled on it. More information can be found here [[Debian]]

- [[Personal/Linux/Distros/Fedora|Fedora]] - Fedora is known for its cutting edge technology often used by programmers for its availability and access to newer software. More information can be found here [[Fedora]]

- [[Personal/Linux/Distros/NixOS|NixOS]] - NixOS is known for its declarative nature and reprodicibility. The packages are not installed imperatively but rather declarative. The files are declared into a configuration.nix file which follows the [[Nix package manager X languaguge|Nix language syntax]]. More information on Nix could be found here [[Nix package manager X languaguge]] and more information on NixOS can be found here [[NixOS]]
