# Linux Knowledge Base

Welcome to my Linux notes. Here you can find all kinds of notes regarding Linux (obviously) like, filesystems, navigation, system tools, distros and their philosophy, scripting and scripting-related (awk, sed, grep), kernels and drivers, system administration and package management and different types of package managers and my dotfiles and personal scripts that I use everyday.

I've been using Linux since my childhood and it plays a integral part in my everyday software usage. So this is one of the most important knowledge that I have in this knowledge vault.

So, starting up, Linux is a open source operating system based on the Linux kernel. So, it's not actually a pure operating system but a kernel on top of which the operating system is built.

## Distros

There are many Linux operating systems or Linux distribution or shortly called [[Distro|distros]] by the community. Each of these distros have their own philosophy of operating system Arch is known for its DIY nature, Debian is known for its simplicity and NixOS is known for its declarative and reproducibility nature.

Most of these distros, have their own derived distros like Arch-Based (Manjaro, Endeavour) and Debain-Based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint). This is to make them more usable out of the box and enjoy the advantages of their package managers.

## CLI/Terminal utilities

Linux is also known for its command line or the terminal. There are lots of [[CLI|CLI tools]] supported and made for Linux to ease the workflow.
Some of the CLIs don't only work as text-based CLIs. They also provide a user interface called as TUIs (Terminal User Interface) which is keyboard-driven.

## Networking

Linux is known for its important role in [[Linux-Networking|Linux-Networking]]. About 96% of the top 1 million servers runs on Linux and its due to its stability and its nature of lightweight. There are lots of CLI tools that are made to simplify Linux networking majorly after the the raising popularity of [[Golang|Golang]] which is sometimes also called "Language of the Cloud".

## Kernel

[[Kernel|Linux Kernel]] is one of the most lightweight and one of the most efficiently functioning kernels out there. Here, there are notes about my Linux kernel knowledge, like user space and kernel space, syscalls, compiling kernels, different types of Linux kernels and much more.

## Package Management

When it comes to [[Packaging|package management]] in Linux, there are many package managers for different distros like pacman, apt, yum, dnf, flatpak, snap(one of the most hated) and much more. All these package managers have their own pros and cons.

## Dotfiles Management

This is one of the most interesting parts of Linux is that its extremely customisable for the user's needs, be it for the workflow or be it for the eye candy. [[dotfiles|Dotfiles-management]].
