# Linux Knowledge Base

Welcome to my Linux notes. Here you can find all kinds of notes regarding Linux (obviously) like, filesystems, navigation, system tools, distros and their philosophy, scripting and scripting-related (awk, sed, grep), kernels and drivers, system administration and package management and different types of package managers and my dotfiles and personal scripts that I use everyday.

I've been using Linux since my childhood and it plays a integral part in my everyday software usage. So this is one of the most important knowledge that I have in this knowledge vault.

So, starting up, Linux is a open source operating system based on the Linux kernel. So, it's not actually a pure operating system but a kernel on top of which the operating system is built.

There are many Linux operating systems or Linux distribution or shortly called [[Distro-README|distros]] by the community. Each of these distros have their own philosophy of operating system Arch is known for its DIY nature, Debian is known for its simplicity and NixOS is known for its declarative and reproducibility nature.

Most of these distros, have their own derived distros like Arch-Based (Manjaro, Endeavour) and Debain-Based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint). This is to make them more usable out of the box and enjoy the advantages of their package managers.

Linux is also known for its command line or the terminal. There are lots of [[Personal/Linux/cli/cli|cli tools]] supported and made for Linux to ease the workflow.

Linux is known for its important role in networks
