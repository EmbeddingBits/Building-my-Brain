`sh`, also known as the Bourne Shell, is a scripting language made for [[UNIX]]-like operating system, which is defined by the [[POSIX]] standards defined by the [[IEEE]] standards. `sh` is a shell so it basically takes input from the user and sends to the operating system to process.

sh is the original UNIX-shell and its the ancestor of many other modern shells like bash, zsh, ksh and dash.

It provides a command execution environment and [[scripting]] abilities to [[automate]] our everyday common [[workflow|workflows]]. It gives us a basic job control and redirection like `>`, `<`, `|`.

It is [[POSIX-complaint]], meaning that it has a standardized behaviour in all the UNIX-like systems.

It is important because its portable and can run on UNIX operating systems.
