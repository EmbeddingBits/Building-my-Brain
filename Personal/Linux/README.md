# Linux Knowledge Base

Welcome to my Linux notes. Here you can find all kinds of notes regarding linux (obviously) like CLI tools, filesystems, navigation, system tools, distros and their philosophy, scripting and scripting-related (awk, sed, grep), kernels and drivers, system administration and package management and different types of package managers and my dotfiles and personal scripts that I use everyday.

My Linux is closely connected to every part of my knowledge as I have been daily driving Linux for many years.
