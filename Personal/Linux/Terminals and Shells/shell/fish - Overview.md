# Fish

Fish stands for Friendly Interactive SHell, a modern UNIX shell made for interactiveness, user-friendliness and out of the box features.

## Key Features:
- Autosuggestions like a IDE
- Syntax highlighting
- Out of the box features
- Web based config UI (type fish_config in the terminal)
- Simplified syntax

Like zsh and bash it is not POSIX-compliant.
