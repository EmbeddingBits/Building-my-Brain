# Terminals

Terminal emulator is basically a text-based interface that helps the user communicate with the [[Shells - Overview|shells]]. There are different shells that provide different features. It is the chat window between the user and the terminal.

It imitates the work of a physical terminal:
- Master: The window that is seen when opened
- Slave - The shell interpreter that runs which processes commands as we type in.

It renders text, different fonts, terminal styling, keyboard input handling, tabs and splits, and mouse support.
### Some of the popular terminal emulators:
- [[kitty]]
- [[alacritty]]
- [[foot]]

These terminals can be furthered made more useful by using different shells like [[fish - Overview|fish]] and [[zsh - Overview|zsh]] with their advanced out of the box features and plugin ecosystem. Terminal experience can also be enhanced by something called as [[Terminal Multiplexers]], there are many terminal multiplexers like the [[tmux]] and [[zellij]].

Terminals can pretty much do everything from basic commands to using it like a IDE with terminal-based editors like [[neovim]], [[nano]] and much more. 

Newer terminal emulators like kitty have GPU rendering which basically uses GPU to render text faster.

The terminal follows the idea of the [[UNIX|UNIX philosophy]].
