## Explore Programming Paradigms

- [[Imperative Programming]] – Direct instructions, change state step-by-step  
- [[Declarative Programming]] – Describe *what* you want, not *how* to do it  
- [[Procedural Programming]] – A subtype of imperative using reusable procedures  
- [[Object-Oriented Programming]] – Organize code using “objects” and “classes”  
- [[Functional Programming]] – Pure functions, immutability, no side-effects  
- [[Logic Programming]] – Based on facts and rules; ask “what is true?”  
- [[Event-Driven Programming]] – Respond to user input, events, or messages  
- [[Reactive Programming]] – Streams and asynchronous data flow  
- [[Metaprogramming]] – Programs that write/manipulate other programs  
- [[Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)]] – Custom mini-languages for specific problems
